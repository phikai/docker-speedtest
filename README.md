# Docker Speedtest

This is a port of the Speedtest Docker Image from [Pedro CÃ©sar](https://github.com/pedrocesar-ti/internet-speedtest-docker/tree/docker_speedtest). A huge thanks to his legwork on the script and ideas.

## Purpose
This is a special purpose container designed to execute [Speedtest-CLI](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) and post the results to a companion InfluxDB Instance.

Image is based on Alpine Linux and available via [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/phikai/speedtest/) as `phikai/speedtest`.
